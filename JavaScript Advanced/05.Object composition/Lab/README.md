Lab: Object Composition
==================================

### 1. Order Rectangles
* You will be passed a few pairs of widths and heights of rectangles, create objects to represent the rectangles. The objects should additionally have two functions area - that returns the area of the rectangle and compareTo - that compares the current rectangle with another and produces a number  signifying if the current rectangle is smaller (negative number), equal (0) or larger(positive number) than the other rectangle.
  * Input: The input will come as an array of arrays - every nested array will contain exactly 2 numbers the width and the height of the rectangle.
  * Output: The output must consist of an array of rectangles (objects) sorted by their area in descending order as a first criteria and by their width in descending order as a second criteria.

### 2. Fibonacci
* Write a JS function that when called, returns the next Fibonacci number, starting at 0, 1. Use a closure to keep the current number.
  * Input: There will be no input.
  * Output: The output must be a Fibonacci number.

### 3. List Processor
* Using a closure, create an inner object to process list commands. The commands supported should be the following:
  * add <string\> - adds the following string in an inner collection.
  * remove <string\> - removes all occurrences of the supplied <string\> from the inner collection.
  * print - prints all elements of the inner collection joined by ", ".
  * Input: The input will come as an array of strings - each string represents a command to be executed from the command execution engine.
* Output: For every print command - you should print on the console the inner collection joined by ", "

### 4. Cars
* Write a closure that can create and modify objects. All created objects should be kept and be accessible by name. You should support the following functionality:
  * create <name\> - creates an object with the supplied <name\>
  * create <name\> inherits <parentName\> - creates an object with the given <name\>, that inherits from the parent object with the <parentName\>
  * set <name\> <key\> <value\> - sets the property with key equal to <key\> to <value\> in the object with the supplied <name\>.
  * print <name\> - prints the object with the supplied <name\> in the format "<key1\>:<value1\>,<key2\>:<value2\>â€¦" - the printing should also print all inherited properties from parent objects. Inherited properties should come after own properties.
  * Input: The input will come as an array of strings - each string represents a command to be executed from your closure.
  * Output: For every print command - you should print on the console all properties of the object in the above mentioned format.
  * Constraints: All commands will always be valid, there will be no nonexistent or incorrect input.

### 5. Sum
* Create a function which returns an object that can modify the DOM. The returned object should support the following functionality:
  * init(selector1, selector2, resultSelector) - initializes the object to work with the elements corresponding to the supplied selectors.
  * add() - adds the numerical value of the element corresponding to selector1 to the numerical value of the element corresponding to selector2 and then writes the result in the element corresponding to resultSelector
  * subtract() - subtracts the numerical value of the element corresponding to selector2 from the numerical value of the element corresponding to selector1 and then writes the result in the element corresponding to resultSelector
  * Input: There will be no input your function must only provide an object.
  * Output: Your function should return an object that meets the specified requirements.
  * Constraints:
    * All commands will always be valid, there will be no nonexistent or incorrect input.
    * All selectors will point to single textbox elements.
