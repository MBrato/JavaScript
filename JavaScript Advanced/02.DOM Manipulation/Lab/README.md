Lab: DOM Manipulation
==================================

### 1. List of Items
* Write a JS function that read the text inside an input field and appends the specified text to a list inside an HTML
page.
  * Input/Output: There will be no input/output, your program should instead modify the DOM of the given HTML document.

### 2. Add and Delete
* Extend the previous problem to display a [Delete] link after each list item. Clicking it, should delete the item with no
confirmation.
  * Input/Output: There will be no input/output, your program should instead modify the DOM of the given HTML document.

### 3. Delete from Table
* Write a JS program that takes an e-mail from an input field and deletes matching rows from a table. If no entry is
found, an error should be displayed in a <div\> with ID "results". The error should read "Not found."
  * Input/Output: There will be no input/output, your program should instead modify the DOM of the given HTML document.

### 4. Stopwatch
* Write a JS program that implements a web timer that supports minutes and seconds. The user should be able to
control it with buttons. Clicking [Start] resets the timer back to zero. Only one of the buttons should be enabled at a
time (you cannot stop the timer if it’s not running).
  * Input/Output: There will be no input/output, your program should instead modify the DOM of the given HTML document.

### 5. Mouse Gradient
* Write a JS program that detects and displays how far along a gradient the user has moved their mouse on a
webpage. Use the provided HTML and stylesheet (CSS) to test locally. The resulting value should be rounded down
and displayed as a percentage inside the <div\> with ID "result".
  * Input/Output: There will be no input/output, your program should instead modify the DOM of the given HTML document.

### 6. Highlight Active
* Write a JS function to highlight the currently active section of a document. There will be multiple divs with inputs
inside them – set the class of the div, that contains the currently focused input field to "focus". When focus is lost
(blurred) remove the class from the element.
  * Input/Output: There will be no input/output, your program should instead modify the DOM of the given HTML document.

### 7. Dynamic Validation
* Write a JS function that dynamically validates an email input field when it is changed. If the input is invalid, apply to
it the style "error". Do not validate on every keystroke, as it is annoying for the user, only watch of change events.
A valid email will be in format: <name\>@<domain\>.<extension\>
Only lowercase Latin characters are allowed for any of the parts of the email. If the input is valid, clear the style.
  * Input/Output: There will be no input/output, your program should instead modify the DOM of the given HTML document.
