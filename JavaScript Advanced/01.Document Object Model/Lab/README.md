### 1. Sum Numbers

### 3. Collect List Items
* Write a JS function that scans a given HTML list and appends all collected list itemsâ€™ text to a text area on the same
page when the user clicks on a button.
  * Input/Output: There will be no input/output, your program should instead modify the DOM of the given HTML document.

loading and will begin to count down from 10 minutes.
  * Input: Your function will receive a number parameter, representing the starting number of seconds.

### 7. * Sum Table
* Write a JS function that finds the first table in a document and sums the values in the last column. The result is then
displayed in an element with ID "sum".
  * Input/Output: There will be no input/output, your program should instead modify the DOM of the given HTML document.
