Homework: Conditional statements
==================================

### 1. Exchange if greater
* Write an if statement that takes two double variables a and b and exchanges their values if the first one is greater than the second. As a result print the values a and b, separated by a space.
* Input: The input will consist of an array containing two values - a and b represented as strings.
* Output: The output should be a single line containing two numbers.

### 2. Multiplication Sign
* Write a script that shows the sign (+, - or 0) of the product of three real numbers, without calculating it. Use a sequence of if operators.
* Input:The input will consist of an array containing three values - a, b and c represented as strings.
* Output: The output should be a single line containing +, - or 0.

### 3. The biggest of Three
* Write a script that finds the biggest of three numbers. Use nested if statements.
* Input:The input will consist of an array containing three values represented as strings.
* Output: The output should be a single line containing a number.

### 4. Sort 3 numbers
* Sort 3 real values in descending order. Use nested if statements.
* Note: Don’t use arrays and the built-in sorting functionality.
* Input: The input will consist of an array containing three values represented as strings.
* Output: The output should be a single line containing three numbers separated by spaces.

### 5. Digit as word
* Write a script that asks for a digit (0-9), and depending on the input, shows the digit as a word (in English). Print not a digit in case of invalid input. Use a switch statement.
* Input: The input will consist of an array containing a single string.
* Output: The output should be a single line.

### 6. Quadratic equation
* Write a script that reads the coefficients a, b and c of a quadratic equation ax2 + bx + c = 0 and solves it (prints its real roots). Calculates and prints its real roots.
* Note: Quadratic equations may have 0, 1 or 2 real roots.
* Input:The input will consist of an array containing three values - a, b and c represented as strings.
* Output: The output should be a single line containing the real roots (see sample tests)
  * Print numbers with two digits of precision after the floating point
  * If there are two roots then x1 < x2

### 7. The biggest of five numbers
* Write a script that finds the biggest of given 5 variables. Use nested if statements.
* Input: The input will consist of an array containing five values represented as strings.
* Output: The output should be a single line containing the answer

### 8. Number as words
* Write a script that converts a number in the range [0…999] to words, corresponding to its English pronunciation.
* Input: The input will consist of an array containing the number as a string.
* Output: The output should be a single line containing the answer.
