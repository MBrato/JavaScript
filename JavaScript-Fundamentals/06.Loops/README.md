Homework: Loops
==================================

### 1. Numbers from 1 to N
* Implement a javascript function that accepts an array with a single element - positive integer N as string and prints all the numbers from 1 to N inclusive, on a single line, separated by a whitespace.
* Input: The input will consist of an array with a single element - the number N.
* Output: The output should consist of a single line - the numbers from 1 to N, separated by a whitespace.
* Constraints: N will be a valid positive 32-bit integer

### 2. MMSA (Min, Max, Sum, Average) of N Numbers
* Implement a javascript function that accepts an array of floating-point numbers as strings and returns the minimal, the maximal number, the sum and the average of all numbers (displayed with 2 digits after the decimal point).
* Input: The array that will be passed as a parameter to your function will contain the numbers of the sequence.
* Output: You output must always consist of exactly 4 lines - the minimal element on the first line, the maximal on the second, the sum on the third and the average on the fourth, in the following format:
  * min=3.00
  * max=6.00
  * sum=9.00
  * avg=4.50
* Constraints:
  * 1 <= N <= 1000
  * All numbers will be valid floating-point numbers that will be in the range [-10000, 10000]

### 3. Matrix of Numbers
* Write a javascript function that prints a matrix like in the examples below by a given integer N. Use two nested loops.
  * Challenge: achieve the same effect without nested loops.
* Input: The input array will contain a single number as string, the integer N.
* Constraints:
  * 1 <= N <= 20
  * N will always be a valid integer number

### 4. Lexicographically smallest
* Write a script that finds the lexicographically smallest and largest property in document, window and navigator objects. Write the script in an external .js file and refer it from a html page.

### 5. Hex to Decimal
* Using loops implement a javascript function that converts a hex number number to its decimal representation.
* Input: The input will consists of a single line containing a single hexadecimal number as string.
* Output: The output should consist of a single line - the decimal representation of the number as string.
* Constraints
  * All numbers will be valid 64-bit integers.

### 6. Evaluated true/false
* Evaluate: true == 5,'not-empty', {}; false == 0, '', null, undefined
